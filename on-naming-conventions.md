# Naming and differentiation of categorical identifiers
The Bbreakfast Post made an excellent laborous study on the anarchy of *Standard ML*'s guidelines 
on naming and separating with the capitalization rules the different aspects of the language, namely `variable`s, `structure`s,
`signature`s, `functor`s and `exception`s. Now they came to their conclusions of a standardized convention through **argumentum ad
popularum**, by apppealing to the wide adoption of each guideline between the most prominent projects programmed in SML. This argumentation
si comparable to Common Lisp's standardization process, which had the more popular implementations blackmailing their concerns with
threats of backing down from supporting tbc
